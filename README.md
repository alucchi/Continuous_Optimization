## Continuous assessment (CAs)

Note the following split:
- 15% continuous assessment (short exercises and Q&As given during exercise classes, Grading: Best 3/6 normalized)
- 20% homework (Grading: Best 2/3 normalized)
- 30% project (writeup and presentation (for bonus))
- 35% written exam

Preliminary dates for continuous assessments (CA): 
1. 03/03/2025 Q&A 
2. 17/03/2025 CA
3. 31/03/2025 Q&A
4. 07/04/2025 CA
5. 12/05/2025 Q&A (topic: SGD)
6. 19/05/2025 CA (topic: Acceleration)


**A 50% score on HW sets is required to participate in the final exam. A 50% score on the exam is required to pass the class.**

## Exams and CAs
Date for written exam: 06.07.2026 Monday 10:00-12:00, Biozentrum U1.101

Information about the exam:
Students are allowed to bring either two double-sided A4 sheets or four single-sided A4 sheets of notes (handwritten or prepared using LaTeX). No other external material is permitted. In particular, the use of mobile phones or any other electronic equipment is strictly forbidden. All electronic devices must be switched to airplane mode during any examination, including the mid-term exam, final exam, and continuous assessments (CAs).

Any attempt at fraud or academic misconduct will be reported to the Dean’s Office.

## Homework
You have to hand in two homework sheets out of the following three options:

1. HW1 Deadline: 24/03/2025
2. HW2 Deadline: 28/04/2025
3. HW3 Deadline: 26/05/2025

Each homework is required to be written in Latex using the provided template. The submitted file name should be in form [full name]_hw[n] where n is the index of the exercise.

**Note:** Each homework is equally weighted. Any homework that is sent late will not be graded and will be worth no credit. 

> Please mention the following declaration regarding the use of AI in your submitted copies.

*"I have taken note of the fact that in the event of justified suspicion of the unauthorized or undisclosed use of AI in written assessments, I am upon request obligated to cooperate in confirming or ruling out the suspicion, for example by attending an interview."*

## Projects
Projects have to be completed within a group of 2-3 students. Two types of projects you can pursue are:
1) A novel and sound solution to a problem discussed in the class
2) Thorough theoretical analysis of an existing deep learning approach discussed in the class
Students cannot use their own published work as the course project.
Deadline: 21/07/2025 12:00 Bern time
Submission: on ADAM
