## Scoring Scheme

Note the following split:
- 15% continuous assessment (short exercises and Q&As given during lectures and exercise classes, Grading: Best 3/6 normalized)
- 25% mid-term exam (written) 
- 25% project (in-class presentation 10%, written report 10%, final zoom presentation 5%)
- 35% final exam (written)


**A 50% score on mid-term exam is required to participate in the final exam. A 50% score on the final exam is required to pass the class.**

## Continuous Assessments (in lecture/class) (TO BE UPDATED)

Preliminary dates for continuous assessments (CA): 
1. 11.03.2026 Wednesday Q&A (Gradient Descent & Subgradient Descent)
2. 20.03.2026 Friday CA (Proximal Algorithms & Newton's Method)
3. 25.03.2026 Wednesday Q&A (Derivative-free & Stochastic Optimization)
4. 17.04.2026 Friday CA (Acceleration & Constrained Optimization)
5. 22.04.2026 Wednesday Q&A (Frank-Wolfe & Lower bounds)
6. 08.05.2026 Friday CA (Adaptive Optimization Methods & Non-convex Optimization)

## Mid-Term & Final Written Exams 
Date for the mid-term written exam: 08.04.2026 Wednesday 10:00-12:00, Kollegienhaus, Hörsaal 119
Date for the final written exam: 06.07.2026 Monday 10:00-12:00, Biozentrum U1.101

Information about the exam:
Students are allowed to bring either two double-sided A4 sheets or four single-sided A4 sheets of notes (handwritten or prepared using LaTeX). No other external material is permitted. In particular, the use of mobile phones or any other electronic equipment is strictly forbidden. All electronic devices must be switched to airplane mode during any examination, including the mid-term exam, final exam, and continuous assessments (CAs).

Any attempt at fraud or academic misconduct will be reported to the Dean’s Office.


## Projects
Projects have to be completed within a group of 2-3 students. Two types of projects you can pursue are:
1) A novel and sound solution to a problem discussed in the class
2) Thorough theoretical analysis of an existing deep learning approach discussed in the class
Students cannot use their own published work as the course project.

In-class presentation: 13.05.2026 Wednesday, 18.05.2026 Monday, 20.05.2026 Wednesday
Written report and final zoom presentation deadline: 21.07.2026 12:00 Basel time
