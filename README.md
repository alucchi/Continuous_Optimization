## Scoring Scheme

Note the following split:
- 15% continuous assessment (short exercises and Q&As given during lectures and exercise classes, Grading: Best 3/6 normalized)
- 25% mid-term exam (written) 
- 25% project (in-class presentation 10%, written report 10%, final recorded presentation 5%)
- 35% final exam (written)


**A 50% score on mid-term exam is required to participate in the final exam. A 50% score on the final exam is required to pass the class.**

## Continuous Assessments (in lecture/class) 

Preliminary dates for continuous assessments (CA): 
1. 11.03.2026 Wednesday Q&A (Subgradient Descent)
2. 20.03.2026 Friday CA (Proximal Algorithms)
3. 25.03.2026 Wednesday Q&A (Stochastic Optimization)
4. 24.04.2026 Friday CA (Constrained Optimization)
5. 27.04.2026 Monday Q&A (Adaptive Optimization Methods)
6. 11.05.2026 Monday CA (Non-convex Optimization)

## Mid-Term & Final Written Exams 
Date for the mid-term written exam: 08.04.2026 Wednesday 10:00-12:00, Kollegienhaus, Hörsaal 119
Date for the final written exam: 06.07.2026 Monday 10:00-12:00, Biozentrum U1.101

Information about the exam:
Students are allowed to bring either two double-sided A4 sheets or four single-sided A4 sheets of notes (handwritten or prepared using LaTeX). No other external material is permitted. In particular, the use of mobile phones or any other electronic equipment is strictly forbidden. All electronic devices must be switched to airplane mode during any examination, including the mid-term exam, final exam, and continuous assessments (CAs).

Any attempt at fraud or academic misconduct will be reported to the Dean’s Office.


## Projects
Projects have to be completed within a group of 2-3 students. Two types of projects you can pursue are:
1) A novel and sound solution to a problem discussed in the class
2) Thorough theoretical analysis of an existing deep learning approach discussed in the class
Students cannot use their own published work as the course project.

The performance on the in-class presentation, final report and the final recorded presentation will be graded equally for each member in the group.

### In-class presentation
dates: 13.05.2026 Wednesday, 18.05.2026 Monday, 20.05.2026 Wednesday
Groups will be arranged to hold their in-class presentation (15-20 min long) about their progress in the projects, including:
i) introduction (motivation, goal ...)
ii) Related Work
iii) Methodology, results in progress

### Final Report
deadline: 21.07.2026 12:00 Basel time on ADAM
Final report should be written in a [conference paper format](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.10292v1). It may only be up to **nine pages long**, including figures. Additional pages containing references, checklist, and the optional technical appendices do not count as content pages. 

### Final Recorded Presentation
deadline: 21.07.2026 12:00 Basel time on ADAM
A recording of the presentation of the final report (15-20 min long) should be uploaded along with the final report on ADAM as well.
